# AuditGetReply should properly emulate auditd's version, we need audit_reply struct , probably reduce duplication of code

#ask about libaudit.c audit_rule_fieldpair_data: strtol vs strtoul

# ask this: -A exit,never -F dir=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins -F perm=x ( what this means, if directory is missing)

better ways to show warnings

Fix audit-go repo to point at the newest libaudit-go
mention in audit-go README about creating new clients as the audit-go or mig audit module using libaudit go
Make clear README examples
