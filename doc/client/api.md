# Client Daemon API

## Conventions and Notation

1. All endpoints using the `GET` and `DELETE` methods accept input in URL parameters.
2. All other endpoints accept parameters encoded as JSON in the body of the request.
3. Data types are expressed using TypeScript's notation for [basic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) and [composite](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) types.
4. We use `Option<type>` as a synonym for `type | null` because the latter disrupts the Markdown formatting of tables.
5. Complex data types like `Target` and `Module` may be defined in [doc/client/api-types.md](https://github.com/mozilla/mig/blob/client-daemon/doc/client/api-types.md).
6. URLs may contain positional parameter for identifiers, which are always strings. E.g. in `/actions/:id/status`, `:id` is a positional parameter.

#### Parameters

The `name` positional parameter in the URL must be the name of the module to retrieve
documentation for as a string. E.g. `pkg`, `file`, etc.

* `400` indicates that the module requested does not exist.

### Create an action

```
POST /v1/actions/create
```

This endpoint can be invoked to create an action.
The action will not be dispatched to the MIG API to be executed by agents right away.
Instead, the action will be retained by the daemon, and its ID will be returned.
This allows investigators to review and modify actions before dispatching them.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| module | string | The name of the module the action should invoke. | "pkg" |
| expireAfter | number | The number of seconds after which the action should expire. | 300 |
| target | Target | A description of the agents to have run the action. | [Target examples](https://github.com/mozilla/mig/blob/client-daemon/doc/client/api-types.md#target) |
| moduleConfig | Module | An object providing configuration values for the module specified. | [Module examples](https://github.com/mozilla/mig/blob/client-daemon/doc/client/api-types.md#module) |

#### Response

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| error | `Option<string>` | If the action cannot be created, an error will be returned. | "Invalid module configuration." |
| action | string | An identifier for the newly-created action. | "abc123...def" |


##### Status Codes

* `200` indicates that the action was created successfully.
* `400` indicates that some data provided as a parameter was incorrectly formatted or otherwise invalid.

#### Example Request

#### Example Response

| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| error | `Optional<string>` | If the action does not exist, an error will be returned | null |
